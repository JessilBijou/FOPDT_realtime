# FOPDT_realtime
 A fundamental model in process control, describing dynamic systems with exponential response and dead time delay.


A First-Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) model is a fundamental representation used in process control and system dynamics. It describes the behavior of dynamic systems by considering their response to changes in input, typically in the form of a step or a pulse. The "First-Order" aspect signifies an exponential response, characterized by a time constant, which indicates how quickly the system approaches its new steady-state. The "Plus Dead Time" represents a delay in the system's response before it begins to change. FOPDT models are valuable for understanding and predicting the behavior of various processes, making them essential tools in engineering and control system design.
